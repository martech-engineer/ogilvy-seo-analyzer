Your copy is scored against these 15 Ogilvy-inspired principles:
- Product Positioning
- Unique Benefit
- Headline
- Reader-Focused
- Clear Tone
- Simple Language
- Evidence
- Emotion / Story
- Structure
- Call-to-Action
- Visuals / Captions
- Testability

The app returns only the **3 lowest scoring areas** with detailed feedback — and then rewrites your copy to meet all 15.

## 🙌 Credits & Inspiration

This app was inspired by a prompt originally shared by **Kieran Flanagan** ([@searchbrat](https://twitter.com/searchbrat))  
and reshared by **Charly Wargnier** ([@DataChaz](https://twitter.com/DataChaz)).  
The prompt has been redefined and extended to support structured evaluation and LLM-based rewriting.

We’re grateful for their creativity and contributions to the AI + marketing community.
